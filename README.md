Developed an advanced parking detection system using OpenCV and machine learning.

#### Responsibilities:
- Integrated a pre-trained car cascade classifier for vehicle detection.
- Processed video data and managed video properties like frame width, height, and FPS.
- Defined and manipulated regions of interest (ROI) in video frames.
- Applied image processing techniques: grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, histogram equalization, and morphological operations.
- Detected parking spots using contour detection and filtered out occupied spots.
- Calculated real-world distances and angles to parking spots from the camera.
- Created visual overlays and annotations for detected parking spots and vehicles.
- Saved processed video with annotated detections.
- Implemented real-time display and user controls.

#### Technologies Used:
- OpenCV, NumPy
- Video processing (VideoCapture, VideoWriter)
- Image preprocessing
- Object detection (cascade classifiers, contour detection)
- Geometric calculations (distance, angle)
- Real-time visualization and user interaction

#### Achievements:
- Developed a highly accurate parking detection system.
- Optimized detection algorithm for performance.
- Created a user-friendly real-time monitoring interface.
